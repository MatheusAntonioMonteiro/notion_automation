# notion_automation
## âš  Note: This code is not a product, it is use only for study.
### About the project:
This project was developed for automate a simple task that I do every week that is add an expense to a notion's database for expense control. I used notion's [API](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started) to configure an integration and use it to add a new expense to my database and also it give me the option to choose create a CSV file with all the expenses that are in the database and then clear all the database so I can start add new expenses in the next month again.

### What did I learn to develop the project?
For this project I needed to learn how to use and get data from an API and also how to create a CSV file and add values to it.

### Coming soon:
I want to develop an functions to get all the expenses that are in the database, like a SELECT, so then I will be able to see if I already added a expense or not.
